# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-MATLAB

The goal of this project is predicting the survival of passengers based on a set of data. Necessary data is retrieved from
 Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster".
 
## Predictions_for_Kaggle
Contains training, optimization of the training model, and performing prediction for partitioned training set's test data and kaggle's test data. Exports .csv file for Kaggle submission. Submission has 0.78947 score in Kaggle competition.

## Titanic_with_DecisionTree
In this file prediction and testing is only done by using training data to calculate average accuracy. It has about 0.80380 average score.
